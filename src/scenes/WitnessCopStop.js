            Without thinking, you reach into your pocket and pull out your phone 
            to begin taking a video of the incident. After a couple of seconds, 
            one of the police officers seems to notice and comes over to ask you 
            to stop filming.

                            After a brief interaction, the police officer is 
                            forced to acknowledge your right to film the 
                            officers performing their public duties. He 
                            grudgingly walks away and leaves you alone. Later 
                            you upload the video, which ends up getting millions 
                            of views.

                            Unfortunately, you don't know your rights and the 
                            cop ignores your stuttering attempts to exercise 
                            them. The cop detains you, forcibly takes your 
                            phone, and searches through it.
